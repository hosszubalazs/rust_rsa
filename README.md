# RSA key generation in Rust

Example project for creating assymetric key cyphers in Rust based on the RSA algorithm.

The solution is heavily under development and is meant for educational purposes only. (mostly for myself) The current solution barely works for very low prime numbers.

## Development environment, runnin the code

Use the official guide to get your environment working: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Use standard `cargo` commands to build/test/run.
